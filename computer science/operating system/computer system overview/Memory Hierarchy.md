# Memory Hierarchy
In computers, memory has to satisfy three requirements - capacity, speed and cost. These requirements constraints each other in the following way.

1. Faster access speed, greater cost per bit
2. Greater capacity, smaller cost per bit
3. Greater capacity, slower access speed per bit

The way to balance and satisfy all these constraints is through by supplementing smaller and faster memories with cheaper, larger and slower memories. The objective is to maximize all three constraints.

Memory is typically slower and is the bottleneck in program execution, therefore, it is important for memory to have fast access speed. The memory should also have enough capacity and not too overly expensive.

## Memory Organization
A typical memory organization has the smallest and fastest memory units at the top (the first being accessed), followed by increasingly bigger and slower memory. The result of such organization is an average time closer to the access speed of the fastest memory.
