## Statements
> [!Definition]
> A **statement** is a sentence that is true or false but not both
> 
> A **statement form**, is an expression made of of statement variables and logical connectives that becomes a statement when actual statements are substituted for the component statement variables.

>[!Logical Equivalence]
>Two *statement forms* are **logically equivalent** if, and only if, they have identical truth values for each possible substitution of statement for their statement variables.
>
>Two *statements* are **logically equivalent** if, and only if, they have logically equivalent forms when identical component statement variables are used to replace identical component variables.

## Tautologies and Contradictions
> [!Definition]
> A **tautology** is a statement form that is always true regardless of the truth values of individual statements substituted for its statement variables
> 
> A **contradiction** is a statement form that is always false regardless of the truth values of individual statements substituted for its statement variables

The truth of a tautological statement and the falsity of a contradictory statement are due to the logical structure of the statements themselves, and independent of the meanings of the statements.

## [[Conditional Statements]]
When we make a logical inference, we reason *from* a hypothesis *to* a conclusion. Let $p$ and $q$ be statements, a sentence in the form "if $p$ then $q$" is denoted by $p \rightarrow q$. The truth of the deduction will depend on the truth value of both $p$ and $q$.
