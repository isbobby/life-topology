> If $p$ and $q$ are statement variables, the **conditional** of "If p then q" is denoted by $p \rightarrow q$. It is only false if $p$ is true and $q$ is false. $p$ is referred to as the *hypothesis*, $q$ is referred to as the *conclusion*.

Conditional statements $p \rightarrow q$ have the following truth values

- $p$ *True*, $q$ *True*, $p \rightarrow q$ *True*.
- $p$ *True*, $q$ *False*, $p \rightarrow q$ *False*.

In the event where the **hypothesis** is not met, we cannot in fairness conclude that the deduction is false regardless of whether the **outcome** is true or false. 

When the **hypothesis** is false, the conditional statement remains true by virtue, or **vacuously true** or **true by default**.

- $p$ *False*, $q$ *True*, $p \rightarrow q$ *True*. 
- $p$ *False*, $q$ *False*, $p \rightarrow q$ *True*.

## Relation with other compound statements
1. Logical equivalence with disjunction $p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg\ p \lor q$ 

2. Negation of a conditional statement $\neg (p \rightarrow q) \equiv p \land \neg\ q$ (hypothesis is true while conclusion is false)

> [!Contrapositive]
> The **contrapositive** of a conditional statement of the form "if p then q is" **If $\neg p$ then $\neg q$**, a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.

## Biconditional
> [!Definition]
> Given statement variables $p$ and $q$, the **biconditional of $p$ and $q$** is "p if, and only if, q" and is denoted by $p \iff q$. It is true if both $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value.
