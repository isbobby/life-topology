The main tool used to prove the correctness of a mathematical sequence is mathematical induction. Mathematical induction is a three step process.

First, the base case is proven, denoted as $P(1)$. This acts like the first piece of domino which sets the foundation of what's going to happen.

Second, a inductive hypothesis is generated where *k-th* case $P(k)$ is assumed to be true.

The last step is the proving step where the *k+1* case $P(k+1)$ has to be proven base on the previously generated inductive hypothesis. A common way of doing it is to substitute the result from $P(k)$ in to the equation of $P(k+1)$.
