An important task in mathematics is the identification and characterization of repeated patterns. The main mathematical structure used in this area of study is the *sequence*, and the main tool for verifying conjectures about these sequences is *mathematical induction*.

# [[Sequences]]
Sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either all the integers between two given integers, or all the integers greater or equal to a given integer.

Commonly used sequences are the summation, product, factorial and N choose R notations.
